## Deployment

### Deploying to Vercel

1. Push your code to GitHub.
2. Go to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) and import your repository.
3. Set the following environment variables in the Vercel dashboard:
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
   - `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY`
4. Click "Deploy".

> **Note:**  
> Make sure your Supabase database and authentication are fully configured before deploying.

### Troubleshooting

#### CSS Linting Warnings

You may see warnings like `Can't validate with unknown variable '--font-ibm-plex'` from the CSS linter.  
These are safe to ignore as long as your custom properties are defined in your CSS (e.g., in `:root`).  
The app uses proper fallback font stacks for all custom font variables.
