## Description

A centralized platform to catalog, score, and assess grassroots climate organizations based on a shared rubric. Admins can review submitted orgs, assign structured impact scores across 13 criteria, and approve or reject entries. The goal is to support a transparent, collective, and scalable ecosystem for climate action, aligned with Music Declares Emergency.
